Hello World! 

- That is a text to say how much I love my parents, my gfriend, my pets, and my friends. Love you Bolinha, Kiki, Zelda, Levi. Thanks for all your support! 



- Tomorrow is Valentine's day and I will cook sushi for us. Congratulations to us! 



- Ok, I was wrong. That day was not Valentine's day, but today it is.
